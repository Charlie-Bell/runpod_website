# Education Overview

Charlie has completed a Master of Science in Control Systems at Imperial college London from October 2017 until September 2018. He received an upper second class, or 2:1, honours.

Before his masters degree, Charlie studied his Bachelors of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Exeter from September 2014 until September 2017. He graduated top of his class with a first class, or 1st, honours.

Before University he completed his A-Levels at Brockhill Park Performing Arts College.

# Education University of Exeter.

Charlie completed his Bachelors of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Exeter from September 2014 until 2017. He graduated top of his class with first class (1st) honours. He received the Dean's Commendation award twice during his three-year education here. The course had a heavy focus on fluid dynamics, thermodynamics and computational mechanics. During the course, Charlie gains an interest in Control Systems and took various optional modules in State-Space Control Systems and Nonlinear Control Systems.

# Education Imperial College London.

Charlie completed his Master of Science in Control Systems at Imperial College London from October 2017 until September 2018.
His final project, or thesis, was related to control of an inverted pendulum in 2 Degrees of Freedom. His education was very heavily focused on Linear Algebra, Statistics, and Optimization.

# Thesis at Imperial College London.

In Charlie's final project at Imperial he constructed and programmed a pendulum and cart which was stabilized in 2 dimensions using propellors. The idea was for the cart to be able to drive independently of the pendulum, and to have the pendulum stabilize itself. The control scheme used was Linear Quadratic Regulation, which is a state-space method to control.

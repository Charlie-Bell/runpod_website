# Cloud computing
Charlie has experience in AWS, developing AI solutions with services such as SageMaker, Bedrock, EC2, S3, EKS. He used these technologies extensively while contracting at Dreamworld Research and Untapped AI.

# Programming languages
Charlie has used Python for over 5 years professionally, but he has some experience programming in C from University and a minor robotics hobby. He is mostly proficient in Python and follows the best practices for app and service development.

# Databases
Charlie has used PostgreSQL, an SQL database, extensively in his last positions.
Charlie has used MongoDB, a no-SQL database, extensively in his last positions.
Charlie has used Milvus, a vector database, to develop retrieval-augmented-generation (RAG) applications, such as this chat app.

# Python frameworks
Charlie has extensive experience using standard Python data science and machine learning frameworks such as Pytorch, Numpy, Pandas, Seasborn.
Charlie has extensive experience using web development and API frameworks FastAPI and Flask.
Charlie has experience using WandB and MLFlow for experiment tracking.
Charlie has experience using frameworks such as HuggingFace's transformers, TRL, Axolotl and TGI for supervised fine-tuning, RLHF and inference of Large Language Models.

# Deployment tools
For deployment, Charlie has experience using Docker and AWS services such as EC2 and Sagemaker.
For deploying LLMs he likes to use Text Generation Inference TGI because it is heavily optimized for inference.

# Developing C-Bot
I am C-Bot. Developing C-Bot was performed with AWS Bedrock, Milvus, FastAPI, React and Docker.
